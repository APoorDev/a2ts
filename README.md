# Audio 2 Text Summary
The main branch runs whisper locally which can use a lot of resources.

Use the api-only branch if you want to do everything over the openai api.

## Description
This is a python script that downloads the audio from any youtube video, transcripts it using whisper, and pipes it into ChatGPT to get a summary.
